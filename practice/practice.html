                    <p>Lotus-- The Aquatic flower blooming most beautifully from the deepest and thick mud. It is a
                        perennially blooming flower with striking symmetry and colours. But, this delicate beauty is
                        much more than just a flower. It is a flower of spirituality and meaning as old as time. Unlike
                        the other flowering plants, Lotus life cycle is different. With its roots padlock in the mud,
                        the flower gets submerged into the water at night and flowers sparkling clean in the morning.
                        Thatâ€™s the reason why in many cultures, Lotus significance is of re-birth, reemergence, and
                        spiritual enlightenment.Because of the lotus flower meaning of purity, grace, fertility,
                        self-regeneration, serenity, and everything divine, it is often placed alongside deity figures.
                        In Hindu culture, it is believed that God and Goddesses ride on the Lotus flower, whereas the
                        Buddhists say Buddha appeared atop on the floating Lotus, and his first footsteps on Earth left
                        Lotus blossoms.

                        Like, each flower colour has its own meaning, so does the lotus flower. yellow for spiritual
                        ascension according to Buddhist traditions.</p>
